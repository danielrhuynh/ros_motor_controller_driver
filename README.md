# ros_motor_controller_driver
A motor controller driver created in cpp, and wrapped using ROS:Noetic!

## How to use:
* The 'robot_driver' package is to be placed in the 'src' directory of your catkin workspace.

## Descrption:
* I wanted to become more familiar with ROS, so I decided to make a ROS wrapper for a cpp motor controller driver!

## Implementation:
Here are some addition things I included for simplicity / coolness:
* I added a launch file such that parameters would not have to be repetitively initilized
* I added an Asynchronous Spinner to avoid delayed callback issues

### Access the docker container of ros:noetic:
* `docker exec -it 'container_name' bin/bash`

### We want to cd into our catkin_ws and source our setup file:
* This is so that ros can find our package and we can run ros and catkin commands
* `source devel/setup.bash`

### If any changes were made, remember to:
* `catkin_make`, `source devel/setup.bash`

### To start the parameter server, in a new terminal:
* `roscore`

### To start the driver, in a new terminal:
* `roslaunch robot_driver rosparam.launch`

### To set speed via publishing to speed_command subscriber
* `rostopic pub -1 /testRobot/speed_command std_msgs/Int32 "data: 10"`

### To stop the motor:
* `rosservice call /testRobot/stop_motor "{}"`

### Setting Motor Speed to 200 keeps it at 5 since Max Speed is 5
